It first reads the input file line by line and ignores any comments. The lines are stored into a list called lines.
It then goes through each line one by one and depending on what the line starts with (if, while, for, do, or a normal statement), it calls the appropriate helper function. 
The helper function for if, while and for creates a node for the condition. Then, it processes all the statements inside the block.
The helper function for do-while creates a node for the first statement inside the do block, processes the statements inside, and then process the while condition at the end. 
Each newly created node is connected to previous nodes from the list called nodesToConnect.
Finally, the program prints out a list of all nodes and a list of all edges.
